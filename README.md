# jMusic
By Sohail Siadatnejad.

Isfahan, Iran (1999)

jMusic was the first iteration (my first attempt) to create a real-time audio system back in Summer of 1999. jMusic was the precursor to [Mehr32](https://github.com/sohale/mehr32).

It was a later rewritten in C++ as [Mehr32](https://github.com/sohale/mehr32) in 2000.

I intend to improve the code gradually. For the original [summer 1999 version](https://github.com/sohale/jMusic/tree/as-in-1999) click on the [`as-in-1999`](https://github.com/sohale/jMusic/tree/as-in-1999) branch (pushed the 1999 files to github on 2014)
